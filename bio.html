                  <p>One of the mentalities in his surrounding is, if you can't hit a high note you can'tsing. That characteristic has grown into him and made him a competitive person.</p>
                  <p>He always loved the music even when he was a young kid. James has been singing, dancing and has been introduced to some instruments since he was a young kid. James have not decided to jump into music in his early age because of his doubts when it comes to his capabilities.</p>

Two years later he has been introduced to a great Music Academy and fantastic vocal coach where he could grow even further in music and decided to live his dream.</p>
                  <p>He grew up listening to 70’s, 80’s, 90’s and 2000’s music. The genre can go from Filipino songs, to Alternative rock to RnB music . This is because everyone in the Philippines loves singing and loves karaoke's.</p>
                  <p>As he grew older, he has been heavily influenced by RnB, Soul, Neo-Soul, and Jazz artist. To name a few these are the artist:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>D’Angelo</li>
                    <li>Miguel</li>

                  <p>The list can go on!</p>
                  <p>What you can expect from James is not just his artistry but also, diversity of musicality. He also aspire to inspire and motivate others to do what they love and show they craft regardless of the cirumstances.</p>
                  <p>​James’ artistry is based on his experiences, struggles, growth, love, and emotions. James aspire to influence people through his music, word, action, and performance.</p>
